- All stories have acceptance criteria and implementation tasks.
- Work can be tracked in the Kanban board.
- Security, privacy, and testability concerns are considered.

## Features

- [ ] Plans and Limits
- [ ] Billing Integration Skeleton

## Monorepo Enrichment

### Delivery Shape

- Anchor this epic in future `packages/billing` plus protected `apps/web` commercial workflows.
- Sequence child features so deterministic local analysis comes before provider, AI, or commercial expansion.
- Keep GitHub issue content aligned with `planning/portfolio/portfolio.json` and the Markdown body files.

### Validation Expectations

- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` before marking done.
- Verify child features are sequenced around deterministic engines before AI or commercial expansion.

### Privacy Boundary

- Never commit real bank statements, account numbers, card numbers, IDs, emails, phone numbers, or raw statement text.
- Logs, telemetry, tests, and issue examples must remain privacy-safe.
